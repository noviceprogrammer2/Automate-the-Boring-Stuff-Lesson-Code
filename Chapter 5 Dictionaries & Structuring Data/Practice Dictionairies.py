#Testing Dictionaries code

#With dictionairies, order does not matter compared to lists

# keys are the front part of the dictionary ex 'color': 'red', color is the key
# values are the parts associated with the key, for color it would be red
# itemas are the key-value pairs when printed
# Can list parts of dictionary if wanted using this syntax list(spam.keys()) which lists the keys of the dictionary
